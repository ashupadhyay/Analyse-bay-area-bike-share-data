# Analyse-bay-area-bike-share-data

In this project, I conducted an overview of what a data analyst does regularly. After this project I was able to identify the key steps of the data analysis process. I **investigated a raw dataset** and shared my findings using a **Jupyter Notebook**. 
Using real-life data provided by Bay Area Bike Share, I determined differences in usage between commuters and tourists' ridership patterns, average duration of trips, and more!

Data analysts collect, organize, study, and present data in order to answer interesting questions and aid in decision making. The steps I took in this project I was equipped with a diverse set of skills to help myself tackle a wide variety of data analysis problems as a Data Analyst.

Using this project I was able to understand how to use **Python language and how it is used inside a Jupyter Notebook**
I learnt the different aspects of the Jupyter Notebook like 
- Notebook Interface
- Code Cells
- Markdown Cells
- Magic Keywords

A brief of what I did in this project can be found
1. Formed two primary questions to be answered using the given data
2. Conducted my own analysis
3. Created different visualizations to communicate findings in the data 
4. Answered the question: Which five-minute trip duration shows the most number of trips? Approximately how many trips were made in this range?
